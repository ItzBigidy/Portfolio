# Personal Portfolio

## <u>Description</u>

Hello, my name is Adrian Acosta and this is my professional portfolio. For anyone interested you can use this page to learn about me, contact me, view projects I've completed, and download my resume. I created this webpage with hopes of helping me connect with other developers and showcase the projects I've completed, are working on, or even plan on working on. Over time I want to keep this portfolio up to date with projects and even add onto the original code of the page itself.
